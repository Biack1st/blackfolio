                <p>My minimum is 500 robux and 5 usd(via amazon giftcard). Prices are calculated by complexity and how much I have to do to finish the product.  I accept payment via gamepass, group funds, or T-shirt.  Payment must include the 30% tax if payment is done via gamepass or T-shirt. This can be calculated by doing the original price and dividing it by 0.7. I currently do NOT accept USD as payment. ONLY robux.</p>
