                    Hey there! I'm Black! I'm a roblox scripter who has over 3 years in experience!  I've been on Roblox since 2016, I've been making games since early 2017 and have been scripting on Roblox since 2018! I can script in Javascript, Html, C++, C, C#, Css, and typescript.  I can make chat commands, Uis, round systems, voting systems, AI systems, HTTP  systems and more!  I can make almost anything for you for insanely cheap (depending on what you want)
